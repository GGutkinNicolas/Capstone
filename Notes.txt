	-SkydiveBook
		-A Skydive Logbook for iOS platform
	-by Guillaume Gutkin-Nicolas

Project Overview:
	-The project will replace the current physical logbooks handed out at dropzones
		-Make it more protable
		-One less thing to think about
	-Features
		-User Login and Registration
		-Logbook Capability
		-A profile that displays total jumps,....
		-A weather search bar to look up current dropzones weather
	-It is interesting to me because I am in the process of getting my A-license
		-A challenge working with new tech
	-The users of this app will be as many skydivers as I can convince

Similar Existing Work:
	-There are currently two other apps in the iOS store that does the same thing

Previous Experience:
	-Database class
	-I like the challenge

Technology:
	-Developed on a MacBook Pro
	-Used Xcode as my editor
	-Coded in Swift, PHP, mySQL
	-used KeyChain to authenticate the users
	-used MAMP as a local server for database
	-Apple's KeychainItemWrapper files. (To make this an app on the store I must acquire a license from Apple)

Risk Areas:
	-I don't have much experience with anything that I'm trying to implement
	-The 16 week time frame to learn and develop might be too short
				Game On!!!
