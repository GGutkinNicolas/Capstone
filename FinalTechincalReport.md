# Abstract <a name="abstract"></a>

The objective of this application was to create an environment that allows skydivers to log their job information. The main idea was to transition from the current pen and paper approach to a more modern digital system. This application was designed using Xcode, an integrated development environment by Apple Inc. that specialized in the development of macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS software. 
   
To accomplish an easy to use product, I limited the interface to three tabs. The first tab is the Logbook, which displays the users information and allows the user to register a new jump with the “add” button in the top right that redirect the user to a simple form that user can fill out and submit. Once submitted the user is is brought back to the Logbook tab. The second tab is the Profile, that displays the users stats such as “Total Jumps”. The third and final tab is the Weather, which lets the user enter any location in the world in a search bar, and then it displays a summary of the weather for that day and the next.
   
This being my first mobile development project I was quite pleased with the result. I was unable to add an editable profile picture and viewable logbook cells in the time I was allotted. However, I was able to integrate the three tabs mentioned above, as well as a login and registration page that will let me keep track of all users data for future work. A future feature I plan to add is a leaderboard score and challenges for the users to compete against one another.
