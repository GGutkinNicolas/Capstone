**Project Overview**  

-The project will replace the current physical logbooks handed out at dropzones making it more portable and one less thing to worry about packing

    -*Features:*
        -User Login and Registration
        -Logbook Capability
        -A profile that displays total jumps, etc..

-It is interesting to me because I am in the process of getting my A-license and will be using this app to make my life easier.
        
-The users of this app will be as many skydivers as I can convince. USPA's website states that there is around 35,000 skydivers in the us.

-Coded in Swift, PHP, mySQL

-used MAMP as a local server for database

-used darksky API for weather functionality

---

**Risk Areas:**

-I don't have much experience with anything that I'm trying to implement

-The 16 week time frame to learn and develop might be too short
